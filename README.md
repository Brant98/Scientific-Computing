# Scientific-Computing
Lots of fun stuffs about Scientific Computing

## Mini-Bio
Claudio Torres is a faculty member at [Department of Informatics](http://www.inf.utfsm.cl),
[UTFSM](http://www.usm.cl). See my soon-to-be updated [webpage](https://www.inf.utfsm.cl/~ctorres).

I am very interested in Scientific Computing, which includes
Mathematics, Informatics, and anything you want.

## What will this repo contain? (very soon!)
The main idea is to upload all jupyter notebooks
I use in the courses I teach or coordinate.
